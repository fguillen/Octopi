# Octopi is not a monster

Octopi has been rejected by his group because his tentacles are too long... Help Octopi to meet again with the only friend he has, the only one that doesn't look him like a monster.

---

Octopi is a city monster walk simulator. Go through the city trying to not destroy too many things, you don't want to be a monster... but, isn't this what you are?
